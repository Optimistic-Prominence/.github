# OPTIMISTIC PROMINENCE

Welcome to the Optimistic Prominence GitHub page. You won't find much here that is public, but if you are interested to see what we are about - head over to our [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/OptimisticProminence) for all of our latest content!

This organization on Github is where we store all of our behind-the-scenes goodies. If you have a good case for why you might want to see anything under the hood, contact us (info@optimisticprominence.com) and maybe we'll agree!

:mountain: We'll see you at the top! :mountain:
